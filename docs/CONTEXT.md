## Active glossary

**UUID instance.** An identity minted for one Corpus, Study, artifact, or evaluation.

**Typed association.** An exact request/object relationship expressed by the owning schema, UUID, embedded request, or selected Study result index plus Method.

**BlockFrame.** One isolated, nonempty eight-column value covering an exact contiguous single-chain block range, including gas-used-weighted effective priority-fee P50 and P90. It stores chain identity once, derives its extent from its rows, and provides range selection, not finality or provenance.

**Rolling comparison.** One transient held-out reduction that runs completed `K=5`, `K=4`, `K=3`, and `K=2` Evaluation predictions once in descending order under an immutable five-block deadline; each smaller model replaces the preceding prediction and moves one origin forward only after a terminal action.

**P50 fee-inclusive savings.** The arithmetic mean of per-origin savings between the next block and the base-fee-selected block after adding each outcome block's included-transaction effective-priority-fee P50. It is a retrospective representative-cost proxy, not an inclusion guarantee.

**Decision origin.** The decision point immediately after closed parent block `h`.

**Closed parent.** The latest closed block `h` visible at a decision origin.

**Context.** Exactly `C` consecutive closed blocks `h-C+1 … h` selected by block number.

**Horizon.** The exact next `K` blocks `h+1 … h+K` whose complete outcomes define eligibility.

**Action.** Zero-based offset `k` selecting target block `b = h+1+k` within the horizon.

**Role.** One of training, validation, or testing. Training fits weights and data-dependent state, validation selects, and testing measures.

**Selected validation evidence.** One deterministic prediction pass from the selected checkpoint
over the exact validation window, retained with the checkpoint and reduced through the same
observation schema and metric definitions as held-out testing.

**Cost over optimum.** The mean per-origin fraction by which the selected base fee exceeds the
minimum base fee in the horizon. It is the sole validation selection objective and is lower-is-better.
