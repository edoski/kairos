# ADR 0006: Direct Durable Object Authority

## Status

Accepted for Study, artifact, and evaluation objects. The Corpus clause is superseded by
[ADR 0009](0009-blockweaver-dataset-authority.md).

## Context

KAIROS objects must preserve enough authority to interpret corpora, studies, artifacts, and evaluations directly. Their requests and associations contain that authority at the canonical object address.

## Decision

UUIDv4 values identify instances. Corpus authority is external under ADR 0009. Each remaining
completed object owns its exact typed request once at a direct canonical address:

- `studies/<study_id>/study.json`, with each ordered trial's `selected.ckpt` and
  `validation.parquet` under `trials/<method_index>/`;
- `artifacts/<artifact_id>/artifact.ckpt`, `validation.parquet`, and `result.json`;
- `evaluations/<evaluation_id>/evaluation.json` and `observations.parquet`.

Typed requests, embedded associations, and the selected Study result index plus exact Method establish meaning. Study and artifact loaders validate the requested UUID and association. Each completed fit retains its selected checkpoint and one deterministic pass over the exact validation window. Validation and testing use the same observation schema and transient reducer. Evaluation publication validates its inputs before atomically publishing the request and observations at the requested evaluation address.

Before an experiment closes, another experiment author may read its hidden authored `cells.tsv`
to identify canonical records that already exist. After closure, the manifest is authoritative.
Downstream scientific inputs always come from the canonical records, never private work state.

A completed evaluation owns its exact `EvaluateRequest` plus sufficient canonical prediction and outcome observations. Atomic publication owns request pairing, ordered window coverage, and observation value consistency. Transient reduction validates the exact observation schema, trusts those publisher-owned facts, and is recomputed directly from `observations.parquet`; Artifact and Corpus availability is not required after publication. Selection remains recomputed from its canonical Study object.

Artifact fitting and Study assembly use Servatus workspaces. A candidate's full-state `last.ckpt`
exists only while the fit is incomplete. Successful fitting retains the selected weights-only
checkpoint, selected-checkpoint validation observations, and compact result metadata; Study
finalization groups the exact ordered trials. KAIROS supplies canonical destinations, exact work
identities, and application-owned assembly callbacks. Servatus owns exclusive resumable work,
absent-or-complete publication, no-overwrite commit, failure preservation, and success cleanup.
Corpus production remains external. Evaluation and mobile-export publication use the same Servatus
transaction boundary.

## Consequences

Callers supply the typed UUID they intend to use. Durable schemas stay focused, and each transient
operation depends only on the completed object that owns its required authority. Servatus changes
transaction mechanics, not canonical paths, schemas, associations, or scientific meaning.
